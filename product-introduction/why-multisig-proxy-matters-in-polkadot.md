# Why Multisig/Proxy Matters In Polkadot

In the blockchain world, **account security and fund governance** have always been core infrastructure. Whether it’s personal high-value assets, institutional treasuries, or DAO governance vaults, virtually every chain relies on **Multisig** and **Proxy** tools.

## Industry Context: The Universal Importance of Multisig

In the Ethereum ecosystem, multisig has become the de facto standard:

* Around **1% of all ETH** is managed through multisig accounts.
* Leading DAOs (such as MakerDAO, Uniswap, and Aave) rely on multisig or similar account systems to safeguard massive treasuries and governance powers.
* For cross-chain bridges, protocol treasuries, and venture funds, multisig is seen as an irreplaceable security baseline.

In short, multisig is a **prerequisite for a blockchain to mature**.

## Polkadot: Native Support, Stronger Commitment

Unlike many chains that depend on third-party smart contracts, Polkadot natively includes the **Multisig Pallet** and **Proxy Pallet**, demonstrating its strong emphasis on account security and governance.

* On Polkadot, **around 5% of all DOT is managed via multisig**, a higher ratio than Ethereum’s ETH.
* Thanks to parachain interoperability, one multisig account can be recognized and used across multiple chains. This level of flexibility is rare in other ecosystems.

Multisig and proxy are thus **infrastructure-level modules** in Polkadot.

## User Advantages in Polkadot

1. **Easier creation**: Multisig can be set up without deploying extra contracts.
2. **Cross-chain compatibility**: A single multisig account can be reused across parachains.
3. **Proxy + Multisig combination**: Enables easier adjustment of members and thresholds.
4. **Support for nested structures**: Complex account setups can be built to maximize security.

These features make Polkadot’s multisig not only a security tool, but also a governance enabler.

## Challenges Remaining

Despite its advantages, Polkadot’s multisig and proxy system still faces challenges:

**Usability Issues**

* Multisig accounts often struggle with compatibility in third-party applications.
* The rules are complex, raising the entry barrier for new users.
* While nested multisigs are powerful in theory, they are difficult to use in practice.

**Security Concerns**

* Signing risks remain, with the possibility of blind signing; cross-platform verification is still needed.
* No built-in simulation of multisig transactions, leading to wasted fees from failed executions.
* Lack of widespread best practices for advanced account architectures that maximize security.

## Conclusion

In the Polkadot ecosystem, multisig and proxy are both **safeguards and governance pillars**. They secure treasuries, enable collaborative control, and provide flexibility. But for **mass adoption**, improvements in usability and advanced security tooling are essential.
