# Proxy Introduction

### Proxy:

Proxies allow users to use an account (it can be in cold storage or a hot wallet) less frequently but actively participate in the network with the weight of the tokens in that account. Proxies are allowed to perform a limited amount of actions related to specific [substrate pallets](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/frame-pallets/) on behalf of another account.
