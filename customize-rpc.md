# ðŸ“¶ Customize RPC

Due to factors like region or network conditions, the default RPC connections might occasionally failâ€”especially with the launch of the Omni UX, where multiple network connections make the issue more noticeable.

To address this, weâ€™ve added a customized RPC setting. You can find the entry at the top right of the network connection page or access it through the settings menu.
