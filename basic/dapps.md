# üìç Dapps

{% hint style="info" %}
Mimir's Dapp serves as the gateway for Mimir to interact with other applications. Once a user selects an account (whether it's a single-signature or multisig), they can use that account to perform various operations within the ecosystem through the multiple applications listed in Dapp.&#x20;

## Third-Party Dapp

Many teams are also working on productization, such as Subsquare and Polkaidentity.&#x20;

We will also integrate these Polkadot ecosystem applications, which can significantly lower the barriers to user interaction and have already achieved great success.&#x20;

We also hope to connect with more and more applications, expanding the scope of these applications. Not only single-signature users can experience it, but multisig users can also enjoy this convenience.
