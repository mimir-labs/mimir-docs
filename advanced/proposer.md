# üó£Ô∏è Proposer

**Proposer** is a role newly introduced by Mimir for multisig accounts, specifically for initiating transaction proposals, but it cannot directly approve or reject transactions.

Once a proposal is submitted:

* **If any member approves it,** the transaction will proceed through the normal execution process.
* **If any member rejects it,** the transaction will be voided and will not be executed.

Members can also be proposers at the same time.

Follow the guide to finish setting:

1. Proposer: The address you want to be the proposer of your multisig.
2. Signer: Select the memeber you want to sign the message(It's not a transaction).

## Submit a transaction propose

Keep proposer account connected and select the multisig account proposer can manage.

Proposer can submit any transactions as memebers do, whatever it's a third-party app/batch transaction/template transactions.

The proposer only needs to select corresponding permission when signing.

It is not a transaction as well.

## Handle propose

Transactions initiated by a proposer will be displayed in the **Pending** page in the format shown above.

At this stage, further action is required from the members.

Once a member approves, the transaction will proceed through the normal multisig process.

## Other Features

In addition to Members, Proposers can also use the Batch API to submit transactions to Mimir.

If you want to reduce the risk of a Member's private key being compromised, you can use a new account as a Proposer to utilize the Batch API functionality. Since Proposer don't have to submit transactions, no funds are required.
