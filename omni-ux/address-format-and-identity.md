# ðŸ’¬ Address Format And Identity

Address display depends on the network, but under the Omni UX, your address presentation and on-chain identity still rely on a specific chain.\
In Mimir, by setting a default address format, you can control which address and Identity you want to display.

## Set Default Address Format

Click the copy button to open the address selection sidebar for copying.

If you select system parachains or the Relay Chain, Mimir will ensure that the People Chain remains connected.\
This is to retrieve Identity data for better account display. Unless you have a specific reason, we recommend keeping it connected.
