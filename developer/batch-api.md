# Batch API

If you frequently need to assemble and send transactions and have some development experience, **Mimir** allows you to use the **API** to construct transactions. You can then **restore** the assembled transactions into a **Batch** on the Mimir platform and proceed with execution from there.

## 1. API

**Who can use?**

All members and all proposers! If you want to reduce the risk of a Member's private key being compromised, you can use a new account as a Proposer to utilize the Batch API functionality.
