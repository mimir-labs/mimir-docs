# ðŸª¢ Omni UX

Managing multisig transactions across different chains requires switching networks and interfaces, making the process fragmented and inefficient.

Mimir's Omni UX enables seamless cross-chain multisig management within a single interface, reducing operational friction and simplifying asset management.

## Connect not select

On the network selection page, simply toggle on the networks you wish to connect to. Mimir will automatically establish connections to these networks, and afterward, youâ€™ll be able to initiate on-chain transactions across them without any need for manual network switching.

ðŸŸ¢: Connected

ðŸŸ¡: Connecting

ðŸ”´: Disconnected, you can try reconnecting or switch to a different RPC.&#x20;

## Initiate transaction with less limit

No need to switch networksâ€”just select the appropriate network when sending the transaction.

You don't need to manage networks within Mimirâ€”simply switch networks directly within the application. Mimir will build the transaction on the correct network for you.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
As long as the network is supported by Mimir, you donâ€™t need to worry about being connectedâ€”Mimir will automatically handle the connection.
{% endhint %}

## Handle transactions together

The Pending Transactions page will display all pending transactions across the connected networks. You can select the networks you needâ€” the number in parentheses indicates how many pending transactions are on each network.
