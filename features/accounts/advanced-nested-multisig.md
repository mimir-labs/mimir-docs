# Advanced - Nested Multisig

* Mimir supports Nested Multisig accounts where a Multisig can include other Multisigs as its members. Users have the flexibility to choose between Flexible Multisig, Static Multisig, or EOA (Externally Owned Accounts) as members of a Multisig account. They can also structure these accounts in any hierarchical layering as needed.
* In the future, Mimir plans to integrate Proxy, enabling a hybrid architecture of Proxy and Multisig accounts.
