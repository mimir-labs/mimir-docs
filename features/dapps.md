# üìç Dapps

{% hint style="info" %}
Mimir's Dapp serves as the gateway for Mimir to interact with other applications. Once a user selects an account (whether it's a single-signature or multisig), they can use that account to perform various operations within the ecosystem through the multiple applications listed in Dapp.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Dapp will consist of two types of applications: Mimir Dapp and third-party Dapp.

## Mimir Dapp

Mimir Dapps are launched by the Mimir team after productizing the Pallet. Mimir Dapps present commonly used Pallets in the form of a Dapp, aiming to lower the entry barrier and enhance user-friendliness for the Polkadot ecosystem users.&#x20;

Currently, we have productized the Transfer, and in the future, we plan to offer productized solutions for common features like Proxy, Governance, Batch, etc.

## Third-Party Dapp

Many teams are also working on productization, such as Subid and Polkassembly.&#x20;

We will also integrate these Polkadot ecosystem applications, which can significantly lower the barriers to user interaction and have already achieved great success.&#x20;

We also hope to connect with more and more applications, expanding the scope of these applications. Not only single-signature users can experience it, but multisig users can also enjoy this convenience.
