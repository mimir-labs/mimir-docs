Batch transactions allow users to bundle multiple operations into a single transaction. This significantly reduces gas fees and simplifies transaction complexity, making it highly beneficial for users performing complex interactions.&#x20;

In the Ethereum ecosystem's Safe, batch transactions can be created through contract assembly and a visualized batch transaction feature. When a user wishes to send a batch transaction, Safe provides an option to add the transaction to a batch, allowing users to temporarily save it.&#x20;

Users can add multiple transactions to the batch based on their needs, and when ready, they can select the desired transactions from the batch and send them as a single transaction to the blockchain.
