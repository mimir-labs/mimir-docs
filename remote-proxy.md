# ðŸ›œ Remote Proxy

Instead of setting up proxy accounts again and again on each parachain, remote-proxy module allows you to create it once on the Relay Chain â€” then compatible parachains can automatically inherit that proxy.

## Set up

No extra steps are needed â€” once you create a proxy on the Relay Chain (including both standard and Pure Proxies), you're good to go.

## Check Remote Proxy

You can create the proxy as usual on the Relay Chain.

## Use Remote Proxy

From there, you can use Remote Proxy just like any regular proxy account â€” to send or receive funds, participate in governance, staking, or any other supported actions. Without worrying about asset loss.
